    <h2>I am Yuexian Chen.</h2>
    <p>I am a third-year Computer Science student, though I previously studied part-time.
      After transferring from the University of Adelaide, some of my completed courses were 
      credited towards my degree at UNSW. I have taken COMP1531 and COMP2521 at UNSW and 
      have also done self-training on LeetCode. I am eager to learn more and apply my knowledge 
      through hands-on experience in your society.</p>
